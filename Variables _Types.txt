What is a Variable?
A variable is something that can change or vary in a study. It is a characteristic or trait(feauture of something or someone)
that can be measured or categorized, and it can have different values for different people or things.

Example:
Age is a variable because different people can have different ages.
Color of a car is a variable because cars can be different colors.
In short, a variable is any factor that can take on different values.


For example, in a study about students in a school, the variables could include:
Age
Gender
Height
GPA
Favorite subject

Types of Variables:
Variables can be broadly classified into two types:

Quantitative Variables
Qualitative (Categorical) Variables
1. Quantitative Variable:
Definition: A quantitative variable is a variable that represents a measurable quantity.
It has numerical values that can be used for mathematical operations (like addition, subtraction, etc.).
Quantitative variables are also known as numerical variables because they express amounts or quantities.

Key Points:

Quantitative variables can be counted or measured.
They have meaningful numerical values that can be used in calculations.
Quantitative variables can be divided into discrete and continuous variables.
Examples of Quantitative Variables:
Height (e.g., 150 cm, 175 cm, 180 cm)
Weight (e.g., 50 kg, 75 kg, 90 kg)
Age (e.g., 10 years, 25 years, 45 years)
Salary (e.g., $30,000, $50,000, $100,000)
Number of children in a family (e.g., 0, 2, 4)

Types of Quantitative Variables:
Discrete Variables: These are variables that take on countable values. Discrete variables can only take
specific, distinct values, often integers (whole numbers).

Example: Number of children in a family, number of cars in a parking lot.

Continuous Variables: These are variables that can take on an infinite number of values within a given range.
They can be measured to any level of precision.

Example: Height, weight, time, temperature.





2. Qualitative (Categorical) Variable:
Definition: A qualitative variable, also called a categorical variable, represents categories or qualities 
rather than numerical values. It describes a characteristic or attribute that can be used to sort or classify
data into groups or categories.

Key Points:

Qualitative variables cannot be used for mathematical operations.
They are used to describe the type or category of something.
Qualitative variables can be divided into two main types:
Nominal Variables
Ordinal Variables
Examples of Qualitative (Categorical) Variables:
Gender (e.g., Male, Female)
Marital status (e.g., Single, Married, Divorced)
Favorite color (e.g., Red, Blue, Green)
Blood type (e.g., A, B, AB, O)
Car brand (e.g., Toyota, Honda, Ford)
 
Types of Qualitative Variables:
Nominal Variables: These are categorical variables that have no inherent order. The categories are just 
different from one another but cannot be ranked or ordered.

Example: Hair color (Black, Brown, Blonde, Red), Favorite fruit (Apple, Orange, Banana).

Ordinal Variables: These are categorical variables that have a meaningful order or ranking,
but the distances between the categories are not meaningful.

Example: Education level (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD), Customer satisfaction rating (Very Poor,
Poor, Neutral, Good, Excellent).
